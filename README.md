## Development environment

The GDAL tools are required to convert geographic data, and in order for all of the tests to pass.

Development requires Python 3.6.2 or later, we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

    make init
    make
    python -m digital-land --help

## Release procedure

Update the tagged version number:

    make bump

Build the wheel and egg files:

    make dist

Push to GitHub:

    git push && git push --tags

Wait for the [continuous integration tests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/digital-land/) to pass and then upload to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/digital-land/):

    make upload
