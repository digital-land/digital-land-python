      add-endpoint-and-lookups       add batch of endpoints from csv

## Development environment

The GDAL tools are required to convert geographic data, and in order for all of the tests to pass.

Makefile depends on GNU make if using macOS install make using brew and run gmake.  

Development requires Python 3.6.2 or later, we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

    make init
    make
    python -m digital_land --help


## Commands Guide

### add-endpoint-and-lookups

This command allows for adding multiple endpoints and lookups for 
datasets within a given collection, driven by entries in a csv file.

Detailed instructions for running this command can be found in the Data Operations manual
within the MHCLG technical documentation repository.

**Use with caution**

(currently only successfully tested on Brownfield Land collection)


## Release procedure

Update the tagged version number:

    make bump

Build the wheel and egg files:

    make dist

Push to GitHub:

    git push && git push --tags

Wait for the [continuous integration tests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/digital-land/) to pass and then upload to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/digital-land/):

    make upload
